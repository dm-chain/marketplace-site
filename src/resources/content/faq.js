    title: 'What Is an NFT?',
    content: `<p>NFT (non-fungible token) is a unique digital asset that represents some other
          data like texts, images, music, collectibles, in-game items, financial instruments,
          videos, etc. NFTs are hosted on Free Ton blockchain and they generally work as cryptocurrencies
          like Bitcoin or Ethereum. But that’s where the similarity ends. Let's make it clearer.</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrencies are conditionally interchangeable, like USD and EUR.
          That means that, for example, one bitcoin in the wallet of one person
          is equal to one bitcoin in the wallet of another person. In contrast,
          one NFT token that represents an image is not equal to one NFT token of another
          user, since it can be different images with different values.</p>

        <p>
          NFTs are unique and each of them exists in a single copy.
          Each token contains identifying information recorded in its smart
          contract. This is what makes each NFT unique.
        </p>

        <p>
          NFT solves the problem of securing property rights of digital objects.
          Information about the owner and his tokens is fixed in
          the blockchain, and it is impossible to replace or delete it.
        </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'What Is a Smart Contract?',
    content: `<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, a smart contract is an application
        or program running on the blockchain. A smart contract works like a
        normal sales contract or money exchange, but all of this happens in
        digital form. If we speak of the blockchain, smart contracts allow you
        to create trust protocols. This means that the parties to the contract
        can assume obligations through the blockchain without knowing each other.
        Formally, our NFTs are smart contracts, using TIP-3 standart. </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'What is Minting?',
    content: `<p>
        Minting (or forging) is the process of creating cryptocurrencies using a Proof
        of Stake (PoS) protocol. Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), this algorithm has specified
        input parameters with a constant characteristic based on the available savings of coin holders.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner does not need to perform calculations and waste resources on mining.
        Instead, he receives a reward in the form of commission payments for transactions
        within the blockchain. Remuneration depends on the percentage of his ownership in
        the total mass of coins. So, for example, if there is 5% of all coins in his wallet,
        remuneration would be 5% of the blocks generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for NFT, if you want to create your own NFTs you need to mint it,
          which means you should pay a minting fee.
      </p>`,
  },
  {
    title: 'How to create NFT?',
    content: `<p>
        To work with NFT platforms, you'll need an Extraton wallet and author's
        work that you'll  attach to the token. This could be an image,
        an audio clip, a video clip, a 3D-model, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating NFT via exchange:
